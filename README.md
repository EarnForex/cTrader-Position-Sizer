# cTrader Position Sizer

The cTrader Position Sizer robot by EarnForex.com is a version of the [similar MetaTrader tool](https://github.com/EarnForex/PositionSizer).

It can automatically calculate the volume of a trade based your risk inputs, the size of your account, the currencies involved, your broker's commission, and your personal preferences.

It is a customizable robot that, addition to standard position sizing, can help you understand the margin, potential portfolio risk & profit, and swaps involved in your trade.
